<strong> The Motto - *Don't let a late start ruin your entire day!* </strong>

## 📖 About The Project

FlexiPlanner - The Dynamic Wake-Up Scheduler is a web application that helps you salvage your day even when you wake up later than planned. Instead of feeling demotivated about missing your ideal wake-up time, this tool helps you create an adjusted schedule and make the most of your remaining day.
- *I Love to call every Project a "Product" and always aim to make one.*

### 🌟 The Story Behind

This project was born from a personal challenge - the frustration of feeling like a whole day was wasted just because of waking up an hour late. What started as a simple solution turned into an intense 15-hour coding (10 PM to 2 PM the next day), representing my first step into web development.

### 🛠️ Built With

- **Backend**: Python & Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML & Tailwind CSS
- **Development Time**: 15 hours of continuous coding
- **Status**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## ✨ Features

- Input your actual wake-up time
- Get a personalized schedule for the remaining day
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Target 6 hours of Deep Work session each of 2 hours.
- 7 PM to 11 PM is the Un-Productive time.
